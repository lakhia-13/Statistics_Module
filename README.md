# Statistics_Module
This is a simple program that calculates various values involved in statistical calculations. 
It is my college sem-1 project and the file is the final verison hence it is called Final.c

Since it is a C program it will need to be compiled. I suggest using GCC as that is what I 
used and it has not provided me with errors.

This program uses the <stdio.h> and <math.h> header files. Sometimes the <math.h> file does 
not compile properly. In such an event use the following code to compile iyt in the 
terminal (bash shell in my case):

gcc Final.c -o Final -lm
The '-lm ' compiles the <math.h> file.

To run it use the code:
  ./Final

This may differ if you create an a.out output file.
